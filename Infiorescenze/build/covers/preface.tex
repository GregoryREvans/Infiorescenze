\underline{Thaumaturgike}, is that Art Mathematicall, which giueth certaine order
to make straunge workes, of the sense to be perceiued, and of men
greatly to be wondred at. By sundry meanes, this \textit{Wonder-worke} is
wrought. Some, by Pneumatithmie. As the workes of Ctesibius and
Hero, Some by waight. wherof Tim√¶us speaketh. Some, by Stringes
strayned, or Springs, therwith Imitating liuely Motions. Some, by other
meanes, as the Images of Mercurie: and the brasen hed, made by Albertus
Magnus, which dyd seme to speake. Boethius was excellent in these
feates. To whom, Cassiodorus writyng, sayth. Your purpose is to know
profound thynges: and to shew meruayles. By the disposition of your
Arte, Metals do low: Diomedes of brasse, doth blow a Trumpet loude:
a brasen Serpent hisseth: byrdes made, sing swetely. Small thynges we
rehearse of you, who can Imitate the heauen.

\includegraphics[height=1cm]{./images/signature.png} \pmb{Non-power-of-2 denominated time signatures} : In this work, some measures are durated by a time signature with a denominator which is not a power of 2. ``In each case, the principle applicable to the derivation of more conventional meters (understood as subdivisions of a whole note) is maintained. For example, $\frac{2}{10}$ signifies a bar composed of two beats, each of which is equal to one-tenth of a whole note.'' Just as in much contemporary music where the time signatures of compound meters do not prolate the contents of their measures (e.g. a quarter note in $\frac{6}{8}$ and in $\frac{3}{4}$ are fundamentally the same speed) so too do these unusual time signatures preserve the basic metronomic tempo. \\
